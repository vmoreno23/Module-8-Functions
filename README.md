# Module-8-Functions

Hello my name is Victor, I am the author of these programs. There are five Python code programs within this repository. To use each of the programs paste the program's code into a text editor with Python support, run the program, and follow any on screen instructions and the results will be provided

Program 1 asks to write a function that takes two inputs from a user and prints whether they are
equal or not.

Program 2 asks to write a function that takes two inputs from a user and prints whether the sum is
greater than 10, less than 10, or equal to 10.

Program 3 asks to write a function that takes a list and prints if the value 5 is in that list.

Program 4 asks to write a function that takes a year as a parameter and returns True if the year is a
leap year, False if it is otherwise.

Program 5 asks to write a function that checks whether your game character has picked up all the items needed to perform certain tasks and checks against any status debuffs. Starter code provided by Professor Braun.
